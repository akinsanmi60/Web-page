      "the adamawa state university (adsu) in mubi has complained that indigenes of the state are not filling the slots provided for them in admissions.\nvice-chancellor of the university, professor kaleptapwa farauta who made the complaint during a press interview at her office, expressed the hope that the people of the 21 local government areas which make up adamawa state and contribute to the funding of the university will begin to seek value for their investment by making their children attend the university.\nthe vice-chancellor stressed that getting enough indigenes to fill their quota poses a major challenge for the university.\nshe said, “we have the challenge of students in the lgas not applying to be students of the adamawa state university. the people in the lgas are our major stakeholders, but they don’t apply to come here.”\nshe said the locals were yet to accept that they need to benefit directly from the university to justify their investment, reiterating that rather than such happening, the university finds after every admission exercise that so many of the lgas fall short of the number of new intakes expected from them.\nprofessor farauta said, “they let go of their slots by not bringing enough candidates to fill up the gaps. this is a major challenge because being a state university, we are expected to provide adequately for every part of the state.”\nprofessor kaleptapwa who spoke to newsmen on the side of nuga prelimanay zonal playoffs which entered its third day at the adsu sports complex on wednesday, said, “we want to use this medium to ask our people to please bring their children to this university.”",
